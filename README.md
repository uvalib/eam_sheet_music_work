# Early American Sheet Music Project

In 2007 the Music Library of the University of Virginia received a grant to digitize and make discoverable part of a collection of sheet music, cataloged by Lynne McRae, housed in the Albert H. Small Special Collections Library.  Digitization Services scanned and provided metadata for each item.  Simultaneously, the Music Library used the old catalog records, generously donated back to the Library by Mr. McRae, to create MARC records for each individual item and add them to the University's cataloging system.  As a result, each item was now individually discoverable rather than only as a collection (as had heretofore been true).

The scans completed by Digitization Services, however, were done outside of current (as of 2011) digitization practices and standards.  In Fall 2011, Andrew Curley and Matthew Stephens worked to "migrate" this content to current standards.  This migration invloved:

* Linking individual pieces to their MARC record via the barcode (or item id).
* Creating new Units and Bibliographic Records in Tracksys for each piece.
* Downloading the images and their metadata from archival storage.
* Renaming each image to match up to it's new filename (derived from the Unit number).
* Add all records back to Tracksys.
* Re-archive the TIFF images to archival storage.
* Ingest items into Fedora digital repository

Inclued in this repo are various files that were either inputs, products or tools used to accomplish this work.
